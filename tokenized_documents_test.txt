a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-series data with missing values ( slac-time ) : an application to tbi phenotyping.self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data . however , real-world time-series data often include missing values , and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering , which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations . to address these challenges , we present a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-series data with missing values ( slac-time ) . slac-time is a transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations . this method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations . it iteratively clusters the learned representations with the k-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters . to evaluate our proposed approach , we applied it to clustering and phenotyping traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) patients in the transforming research and clinical knowledge in traumatic brain injury ( track-tbi ) study . clinical data associated with tbi patients are often measured over time and represented as time-series variables characterized by missing values and irregular time intervals . our experiments demonstrate that slac-time outperforms the baseline k-means clustering algorithm in terms of silhouette coefficient , calinski harabasz index , dunn index , and davies bouldin index . we identified three tbi phenotypes that are distinct from one another in terms of clinically significant variables as well as clinical outcomes , including the extended glasgow outcome scale ( gose ) score , intensive care unit ( icu ) length of stay , and mortality rate . the experiments show that the tbi phenotypes identified by slac-time can be potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic strategies .

the effect of a priming-based training on the production of object clitic pronouns in italian speaking children with dld.children with developmental language disorders ( dld ) have impaired morphosyntactic abilities despite age-appropriate nonverbal cognitive abilities and no hearing disorders or brain injury . the persistent omission of third-person object clitic pronouns ( 3do clitics ) has been proven to be a clinical marker of developmental language disorders ( dld ) for both preschool and school-aged italian-speaking children . according to the model of 3do clitic derivation recently brought to attention , 3do clitic omission is a morphosyntactic matter and , therefore , we argue that the production of 3do clitics can be enhanced through morphosyntactic priming in children with dld . to corroborate this hypothesis , we administered a 3do clitic training based on a morphosyntactic priming paradigm to 23 typically developing ( td ) children and 11 children with dld . results show that their 3do clitic production is enhanced after the training and that these effects are persistent in time . our results suggest that a priming-based training can concretely help children with dld in their language development .

ultrastructural and molecular investigation on peripheral leukocytes in alzheimer 's disease patients.thriving literature underlines white blood cell involvement in the inflammatory processes of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) . among leukocytes , lymphocytes have been considered sentinels of neuroinflammation for years , but recent findings highlighted the pivotal role of neutrophils . since neutrophils that infiltrate the brain through the brain vascular vessels may affect the immune function of microglia in the brain , a close investigation of the interaction between these cells is important in understanding neuroinflammatory phenomena and the immunological aftermaths that follow . this study aimed to observe how peripheral leukocyte features change at different stages of ad to identify potential molecular markers when the first features of pathological neurodegeneration arise . for this purpose , the examined patients were divided into mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and severely impaired patients ( dat ) based on their cognitive dementia rating ( cdr ) . the evaluation of the neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio and the morphology and function of leukocytes showed a close relationship between the ultrastructural and the molecular features in ad progression and suggested putative markers for the early stages of the disease .
developing behavioural activation for people with acquired brain injury : a qualitative interpretive description study of barriers and facilitators to activity engagement.acquired brain injuries ( abi ) from stroke , head injury , or resected brain tumours are associated with poor emotional wellbeing and heightened risk of mood disorder . common sequalae of abi , such as poor attention and memory , can create barriers to the efficacy of cognitively demanding mood interventions , such as cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) . behavioural activation ( ba ) , where individuals plan and engage in reinforcing activities , is a promising alternative due to lower cognitive demands . however , ba was initially developed in clinical populations without abi where the primary barriers to activity engagement were low mood and anxious avoidance . additionally , ba can incorporate a range of techniques ( e.g. , mood monitoring , activity scheduling , targeting avoidance , contingency management ) and psychoeducational topics ( e.g. , mindfulness , managing uncertainty ; social/communication skills ) . exploring barriers and facilitators to adopting specific ba components in abi is an important aim .
omarigliptin protects the integrity of the blood-brain barrier after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) is a fatal disease without effective treatment . the damage of the blood-brain barrier ( bbb ) is a key cause of brain edema and herniation after ich . omarigliptin ( also known as mk3102 ) is a potent antidiabetic that inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase ( dpp4 ) ; the latter has the ability to bind and degrade matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) . the present study aims to investigate the protective effects of omarigliptin against the destruction of bbb following ich in mice .
sex and interferon gamma signaling regulate microglia migration in the adult mouse cortex in vivo.although microglia possess the unique ability to migrate , whether mobility is evident in all microglia , is sex dependent , and what molecular mechanisms drive this , is not well understood in the adult brain . using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging of sparsely labeled microglia , we find a relatively small population of microglia ( ~5 % ) are mobile under normal conditions . following injury ( microbleed ) , the fraction of mobile microglia increased in a sex-dependent manner , with male microglia migrating significantly greater distances toward the microbleed relative to their female counterparts . to understand the signaling pathways involved , we interrogated the role of interferon gamma ( ifnγ ) . our data show that in male mice , stimulating microglia with ifnγ promotes migration whereas inhibiting ifnγ receptor 1 signaling inhibits them . by contrast , female microglia were generally unaffected by these manipulations . these findings highlight the diversity of microglia migratory responses to injury , its dependence on sex and the signaling mechanisms that modulate this behavior .

`` talk and chalk '' : an emotion regulation intervention for anger after acquired brain injury.uncontrollable anger is a debilitating consequence of acquired brain injury ( abi ) . this proof-of-concept study investigated the preliminary efficacy of an emotion regulation intervention for managing post-abi anger . a secondary objective was to determine which participant characteristics were related to intervention gains . with a pre-post intervention design and three-month follow-up , there were five individually administered meetings on zoom , over a four-month period . 24 adults who had sustained an abi were enrolled . participants were mostly males , from 24 to 85 years old . a series of one-way repeated-measures anovas were conducted to determine the intervention 's efficacy , and spearman 's rho bivariate correlations for the association between participant characteristics and intervention gains . significant differences were observed in external anger from baseline to post-treatment ; there were no further changes from post-treatment to follow-up . of the participant characteristics , only readiness to change and anxiety were correlated . the proposed intervention presents a brief , feasible , and preliminary efficacious alternative for regulating post-abi anger . intervention gains are associated with readiness to change and anxiety , which has important implications for clinical delivery .
inflammasome activation mediates apoptotic and pyroptotic death in astrocytes under ischemic conditions.inflammation is a hallmark mechanism of ischemic stroke-induced brain injury . recent studies have shown that an intracellular multimeric protein complex known as an inflammasome is a key factor for inducing an inflammatory response , and apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death in ischemic stroke . inflammasome assembly leads to the activation of pro-inflammatory caspases , and the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and il-18 . while the role of inflammasomes in ischemic stroke-induced neuronal death , and microglial activation and cell death have been established , little is known about the role of inflammasomes in astrocytes under ischemic conditions . in this study , we investigated the expression and activation of inflammasome components in protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes under ischemic conditions . we found that both protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes expressed a differential increase in inflammasome protein components , and that their activation promoted maturation of il-1β and il-18 , and secretion of il-1β , as well as initiating apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death . pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 decreased expression of cleaved caspase-1 and production of mature il-1β , and protected against inflammasome-mediated apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death . overall , this study provides novel insights into the role of inflammasome signaling in astrocytes under ischemic conditions .
towards ppg-based anger detection for emotion regulation.anger dyscontrol is a common issue after traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) . with the growth of wearable physiological sensors , there is new potential to facilitate the rehabilitation of such anger in the context of daily life . this potential , however , depends on how well physiological markers can distinguish changing emotional states and for such markers to generalize to real-world settings . our study explores how wearable photoplethysmography ( ppg ) , one of the most widely available physiological sensors , could be used detect anger within a heterogeneous population .
